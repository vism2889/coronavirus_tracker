# coronavirus_tracker

Coronavirus_tracker took first place in the 15-112 hackathon during the spring semester of 2020!  

The app was developed in collaboration with my partners Christina Zhou, Jenna Miller, and Emma Parrella over the span of 24 hours. All collaboration was done remotely via Discord, as it took place during the beginning of the pandemic. The 'Hack 112' event was an activity put together by the staff and TA's of CMU's 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science course.  The guidelines were basically to design and implement something interesting in the alotted time frame.  Submissions were judged based on correct use of the python langage, interactivity, difficulty of concepts implemented, and originality.  

### Overview of the application:

 - Scrapes coronavirus statistics for every county in the United States.
 - Custom interactive GUI made with the cmu-graphics library.
